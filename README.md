# Advent of Code Solutions

This is a collection of some of my solutions for Advent of Code in various languages.
I typically only do a few days per year, and I probably won't post previous years'
solutions.
Note that most of my solutions are garbage.
Despite that fact, reading this code may spoil some challenges for you, so proceed at
your own risk.
